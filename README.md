# Task 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Tools Used
- Wireshark

## Observations
1. Captured TCP handshake between my PC and google.com.
2. Filtered DNS queries and saw how youtube.com resolves to an IP.
3. Compared HTTP (plain-text) vs HTTPS (encrypted) traffic.

## Screenshots
- TCP Handshake
- DNS Query
- HTTP vs HTTPS

## Interview Questions Answered
1. **TCP handshake**: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK
2. **TCP vs UDP**: TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless.
3. **DNS**: Translates domain names to IP addresses.
4. **Packet sniffing**: Capturing network packets for analysis.
5. **HTTPS security**: Encrypts data, unlike HTTP.
